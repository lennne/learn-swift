# Final Project
1. Building a bank simulator

- Create the bank account
- Create bank debit and credit bank account options.
- Define a class and use loops to create a valid bank account based on the userâ€™s choice.
- Use switch statements to select the right type of bank account from the list of valid bank account types provided by the bank account simulator. 

2.  Define the bank account operations
practice working with functions and conditional statements to implement the bank account operations for the account you created. use operations when you manage the account in the last exercise of the project.
- Bank account users can withdraw money from or deposit money in their accounts. 
- You will use functions and conditional statements to handle the different bank account operations logic.
