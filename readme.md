1. Learning Swift Fundamentals

# Final Project
1. Building a bank simulator

- Create the bank account
- Create bank debit and credit bank account options.
- Define a class and use loops to create a valid bank account based on the user’s choice.
- Use switch statements to select the right type of bank account from the list of valid bank account types provided by the bank account simulator. 

2.  Define the bank account operations
practice working with functions and conditional statements to implement the bank account operations for the account you created. use operations when you manage the account in the last exercise of the project.
- Bank account users can withdraw money from or deposit money in their accounts. 
- You will use functions and conditional statements to handle the different bank account operations logic.

3. Manage the bank account
practice working with 
- functions 
- loops
- conditional statements
- switch statements
to manage the bank account you created in the first exercise of the project using the bank account operations you implemented in the second exercise of the project.

The account can be either a generic, debit or credit one. The account’s operations can be withdrawals or deposits. You will use functions, loops, conditional statements and switch statements to manage the bank account’s withdrawals and deposits.
